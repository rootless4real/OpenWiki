Requirements
------------
Before OpenWiki can run you must have the following components installed:
    
    o  MS ADO.DB v2.5 or higher
    o  VBScript v5.5 or higher
    o  MSXML v3 SP2 or higher
    o  A Web Server (i.e. PWS or IIS)
    o  A database like MS Access, SQL-Server, Oracle or MySQL
    
Usually on a standard installed Windows OS all these components are already
present.

Furthermore, if you want to allow file uploads to your wiki, then the
following component must be installed:

    o  ABC Upload v4 from WebSupergoo

See the URLs above where you can get these components.


Database:
---------
By default OpenWiki works with an MS Access database. If you had 
installed the "Sample Application" you'll notice that in the ODBC Data
Source Manager (in Control Panel - Administrative Tools) there's
a new data source called "OpenWikiDist". If it's not there, create one, 
and point it to the distribution database (that is file
<install-dir>\data\OpenWikiDist.mdb).

Make sure that the variable OPENWIKI_DB in file owconfig-default.asp
is set correctly.

If you want to run OpenWiki using MS SQL-Server, first run the DDL 
statements from file <install-dir>\data\OpenWiki-SqlServer, and then 
simply import the MS Access database into your SQL Server database.


If you're using an Oracle database add the following line to your
config file:

    OPENWIKI_DB_SYNTAX = DB_ORACLE
    
You can find the Oracle DDL statements to create a virgin openwiki
database in file <install-dir>\data\OpenWiki-Oracle.sql.

    
If you're using a MySQL database add the following line to your
config file:

    OPENWIKI_DB_SYNTAX = DB_MYSQL

You can find the MySQL DDL statements to create a virgin openwiki
database in file <install-dir>\data\OpenWiki-MySQL.sql.


Web Server:
-----------

o create website or virtual directory pointing to <install-dir>\owbase.
o point your browser to the website or virtual directory. that's all.


Running multiple websites using one OpenWiki codebase
-----------------------------------------------------

See example \web1 
o  create website or virtual directory MyWeb, point to <install-dir>\web1
o  create virtual directory within "MyWeb", name it "ow" and point it 
   to <install-dir>\owbase\ow.
o  point your browser to the website or virtual directory "MyWeb". that's all.
